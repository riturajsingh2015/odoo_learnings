### Workpsace
Since I work on windows for development , I am more comfortable in using VSCODE editor like anz other realistic code nowadays and for running odoo environment , I use Docker rather than installing odoo on my machine which is faster but not so trendy.

There are some vscode and docker relavant settings which I use for development with odoo that I will elaborate here.

1. tasks.json
2. settings.json
3. docker-compose.yml (explain about entrypoint)
4.  

### Coding guidelines 
Here I will explain about coding guidelines being followed 

#### Python guidelines
1. Blackformatting with 79 line of characters per line ```ctrl + shift + i```
2. Add keywords for every attribute of the odoo field
3. Add commas between attribute of the odoo field
4. Add docstrings for every method
5. Add constants in one file and then import them before using them 
6. Alphabetically sort odo fields
7. Remove unused imports (there should be a shortcut to do this in vscode)
8. Take care of Code cognitivity,methods should not be too long
9. Write methods which are relevant to a model only within that model itself
10. 

#### manifest.py guidelines
1. Blackformatting with 79 line of characters per line ```ctrl + shift + i```

#### XML guidelines
1. Shortcut to format the xml file  ```ctrl + shift + i```
2. Space at the end of xml file
